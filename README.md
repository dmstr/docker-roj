# рой (roj)

Nano-sized & portable environment for Docker swarms and stacks 

## About

Roj is based on native Docker tools to build swarms with `docker-machine` and manage stacks with `docker-compose`. 
Since all tools are run from a docker container, the created configurations (on a host-volume) remain portable.

## TL;dr

    docker-compose run roj
